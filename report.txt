Description by function:
struct operation
		variables opCode var0 var1 var2
		used to store operations in simple structure

main
	checks if filename was passed prints usage otherwise
	Initializes all memory to 0
	calls readBinary

readBinary(char* filename)
	opens file prints error if failed
	using while loop checks how many operations there are
		could not find a more elegant solution than reading whole file
	Creates a array of operations then stores the 4 values in each index
	Runs while loop through operations list switch statement to handle each 			operation type and calls respective function
varRead(unsigned int var)
	checks if variable is address or constant and returns correct value
memRead(unsigned int address)
	checks if address is in readable memory then returns the value at address
memWrite(unsigned int adress usigned int value)
	checks if address is in readbale memory then stores vlaue in memory at address

add .. slt(operation* op)
	performs respective operation and stores value in memory / prints / changes
